# PRT453 group project


## About

This is the repository for group A's group project in PRT453, 2018.
Group members: Samuel, Rahul, Bibin, and Jasleen.

Code is from an example java project. THe aim of this project is to perform
refactorings to patterns and do development according to the Scrum methodology.

The actual software is a car sales management system, providing functions for
managing, viewing, searching, and tracking an inventory of cars and related
information about each car.

## Developing

There are files in the repo to support opening the repository as an [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
project. The project can be run by navigating to `Main.java`, right clicking
and selecting `Run 'Main.main()'` (or press `ctrl+shift+F10`). It should auto
save that run configuration so you can click `Run` from the main menus or global
keyboard shortcut. If it complains about missing project out directory, enter this in the form: `$PROJECT_DIR$/out`.
