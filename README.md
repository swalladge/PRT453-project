# PRT453 group project


## About

This is the repository for group A's group project in PRT453, 2018.
Group members: Samuel, Rahul, Bibin, and Jasleen.

Code is from an example java project. THe aim of this project is to perform
refactorings to patterns and do development according to the Scrum methodology.


## Developing

There are files in the repo to support opening the repository as an [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
project. The project can be run by navigating to `Main.java`, right clicking
and selecting `Run 'Main.main()'` (or press `ctrl+shift+F10`). It should auto
save that run configuration so you can click `Run` from the main menus or global
keyboard shortcut.

Could be a different process for other IDEs; maybe we should find a standard build
system?
